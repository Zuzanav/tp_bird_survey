        <h3>Torrey Pines</h3>
        <p>Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve is a nature reserve located in San Diego, California. It is home to the rarest species of pine tree in North America as well as to many bird species. 
            The reserve's impressive biodiversity includes many different species of birds that make this conservation area their home or that may use it as their stopover point along their seasonal migration routes. 
            The Torrey Pines Docent Society conducts bird surveys every month. While this data is specifically visualized for the Docents at Torrey Pines, anyone can enjoy and learn from this data. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>The Data</h3>
        <p> The data includes up to 174 unique species of birds over the course of 15 years. Because the data spans a large amount of time, it is easy to see 
            the seasonality of some birds. In the graph below, you can select up to 5 different types of birds to compare. You may also search for specific birds if you already have some in mind. Click and drag over any section of the 
            timeline to get a closer look at the numbers for that given time period. Mostly explore, have fun and see if you learn anything!
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Data Collection Methodolgy</h3>
        <p> A party of Docents from Torrey Pines spread out at the reserve once a month to survey different species of birds. They tally the birds they see and/or hear. Over the course of the years, the number of Docents
        conducting the survey has increased and could also be one of the reasons why some birds may be trending upwards.

    <h3>Bird Trends</h3>
    <p> While looking at the visualized data I noticed trends in certain birds. For example, it seems like the California Quail
        population trends downwards over the years, or the California Thrasher trends upwards. Note this trend is localized and may 
        infer a lot about what may be happening at Torrey Pines or San Diego County, even, since the California Thrasher's population is generally declining
        in California.

        Interestingly enough there are some birds who also appear to have an inverted bell-curve, indicating their population bounced back after
        decreasing for a certain amount of years (ex: Royal Tern).

        In order to increase the visibility of the trends, the data displayed below is a moving average of the data displayed above. The moving average is over the course of 15 months to 
        depict as smooth a line as possible.

    <h3>Notice Any Errors?</h3>
    <p>If you are an experienced birder and notice an error, please contact me. Some of the birds have had their common names change in the past decade and a half and
        may result in what appears to have half their data missing when in reality, the second half of their data lies in a different common name. For example, the Western Scrub Jay is now commonly 
        known as the California Scrub Jay.
